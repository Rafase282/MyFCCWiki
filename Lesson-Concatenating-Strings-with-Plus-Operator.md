# Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a String value, it is called the `concatenation` operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

## Example
`'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'`

## Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
