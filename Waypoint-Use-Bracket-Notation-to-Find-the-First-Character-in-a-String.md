# Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
_Bracket notation_ is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at `1` like humans do. They start at `0`. This is refered to as `Zero-based indexing`.

## Example

The character at `index 0` in the word `Charles` is `C`. So if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using `firstName[0]`.
