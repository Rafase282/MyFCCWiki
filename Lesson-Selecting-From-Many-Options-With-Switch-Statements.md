# Lesson: Selecting from many options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a `switch` statement. A `switch` statement tests a value and can have many `case` statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered.

Here is a `pseudocode` example:

```js
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}
```

`case` values are tested with strict equality (`===`). The `break` tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the `break` is omitted, the next statement will be executed.
