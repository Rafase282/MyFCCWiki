# Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash `\` in front of the quote.

`"Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\"."`

This signals JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string.

However another option is to alternate quotation marks if possible.  `'Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript"'` this would also work.
