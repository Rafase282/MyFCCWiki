# Lesson: Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator `.` and bracket notation `[]`, similar to an array.

The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using the dot operator `.` to read an object property:

```js
var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
myObj.prop1; // val1
myObj.prop2; // val2
```
