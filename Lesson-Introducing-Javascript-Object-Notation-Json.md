# Lesson: Introducing JavaScript Object Notation JSON
JavaScript Object Notation or `JSON` uses the format of JavaScript Objects to store data. JSON is flexible because it allows for `Data Structures` with arbitrary combinations of `strings`, `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, and `objects`.

Here is an example of a JSON object:

```js
var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Cassette",
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
```

This is an array of objects and the object has various pieces of `metadata` about an album. It also has a nested `formats` array. Additional album records could be added to the top level array.
