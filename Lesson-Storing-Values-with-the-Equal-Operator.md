# Storing Values with the Equal Operator
In Javascript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment or equal (=) operator.

`myVariable = 5;`

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

```js
myVar = 5;

myNum = myVar;
```
