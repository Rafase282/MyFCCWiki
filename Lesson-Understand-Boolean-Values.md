# Understand Boolean Values
`Data` is anything that is meaningful to the computer.

In computer science, _Data types_ are things that represent various types of data. JavaScript has seven data types which are `Undefined`, `Null`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Symbol`, `Number`, and `Object`.

Booleans can only hold the value of either `true` or `false`. They are basically little on-off switches.
